# ncnode

# NOTE: This project has been merged into the [NClosure](http://gatapia.github.com/nclosure/) project to give all
NClosure users access to the Node core libs through a type safe API.

## Overview
For a demo of what nclosure can do see the generated docs for the [node core libraries](http://gatapia.github.com/nclosure/node/index.html).

## Goal
To generate wrappers for the Node.js core libs that are fully closure annotated
using the nclosure project.

These generated wrappers will take the class structure / information from the:
- Source Files
- Instantiated Core Node.js objects
- The markdown files
- A config file holding typing info

## Goal 2
To provide a real life showcase of nclosure usage
