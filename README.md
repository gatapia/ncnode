# ncnode

## Overview
This project is still in the 'do not use, crazy thoughts being flung around
the room' stage.

For a demo of what nclosure can do see the generated docs for the [node core libraries](https://gatapia.github.com/ncnode/).

## Goal
To generate wrappers for the Node.js core libs that are fully closure annotated
using the nclosure project.

These generated wrappers will take the class structure / information from the:
- Source Files
- Instantiated Core Node.js objects
- The markdown files
- A config file holding typing info

## Goal 2
To provide a real life showcase of nclosure usage
